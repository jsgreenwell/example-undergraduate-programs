## This is just a working example project of Hello World using Java FX 11

I may just add some Javadocs and zip this up for students to have a testable copy of Java 11 w/Java FX 11 to ensure it is properly installed/setup.

## Install instructions must include
- Add the library (or import into project from global libraries)
- Add the module-info file.
