    "## Introduction to csv & sqlite with Python\n",
    "\n",
    "<sup>The following was created with Jupyter Notebooks just to make it easier to add notes and directions - all code can be run under standard Python 3 (only uses built-in & standard libraries) just copy the code portions into your favorite python editor and save the books.csv and dvds.json files to the same directory as project.</sup>\n",

    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>A csv file contains values seperated with a common character. Besides Json these are probably the most common way to save data exported from or to be imported into a database. It is also common with spreadsheets but <i>beware</i> as Excel or Sheets files are not automatically \"csv\"s. Common delimiters (what we call the character chosen to seperate values) include:</p>\n",
    "    <ul>\n",
    "        <li>comma (,)</li>\n",

    "        <li>whitespace or tabs</li>\n",
    "    </ul>\n",
    "    \n",
    "<p>These files are so common that a library to handle them is standard with Python as is the library for communicating with SQLite. An example is below, note to run this you would just have to create a database called \"Inventory\"</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Basic Algorithm of Example 1\n",
    "<p>First we connect to the database then set up a cursor and create the table (you don't have to create the table in code - doing this to show its possible and so it is easier to run - load the data using csv as a dictionary and build an insert query by looping over the dictionary with a list comprehension (covered in class). Then it is just connect and \"executemany\" - execute runs only a single command.</p>"
